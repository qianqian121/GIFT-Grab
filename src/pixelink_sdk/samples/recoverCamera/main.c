// down, without having to having done the necessary 'cleanup' operations.

	//     Initialize the camera in a stream stopped state.  
	//
	//     If a camera control application 'crashes' while stream a camera, then the 
	//     camera is left in a state where it is trying to output images to the host, 
	//     but the host is not in a state to receive images.  This is characterized 
	//     by the camera's LED flashing red.  Under these circumstances, the USB host 
	//     may have difficulties initializing the camera, and establishing a control
	//     control path to the camera.
	//
	//     Under these circumstances, asserting a stream stop state at initialization, 
	//     will ensure the camera control path gets properly established.  Applications
	//     may want to consider using CAMERA_INITIALIZE_EX_FLAG_ISSUE_STREAM_STOP every 
	//     time they initialize a camera, but keep in mind this may not have the desired
	//     effect if you have multiple applications controlling the same camera.
