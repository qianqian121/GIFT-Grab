 *     File: simpleGui.cpp
 *
 *     Description:
 *       This demonstrates how to create a simple camera GUI application for
 *       Linux.  It uses GTK+3 as the base GUI library, with glade to create
 *       the initial graphical layout.  Furthermore, it uses gthreads to create
 *       a separate thread to scan for camera connects/disconnects.
 *
 *     Design Notes:
 *        - This design uses a very simple, 'open' concept of our C++ data objects.
 *          Each of the objects are actually global within the application.  This
 *          simple approach can easily deal with:
 *            o we are using the C variant of glade, with the 'signals' associated
 *              with each of the GUI controls, mapped to a global function
 *            o There is a significant number of 'interdependencies' amongst the
 *              controls; changes the user makes to one control, often has impact on
 *              what is represented in another control
 *        - All of the camera interactions, and their calls to the PixeLINK API,
 *          are in the camera.cpp module.  Camera PixeLINK enumeration functions, are
 *          in this module.
