        Installing the PixeLINK SDK on your Linux system
        ================================================

0. Ensure you have the correct PixeLINK SDK Variant
---------------------------------------------------
  There are 5 variants of the PixeLINK SDK (for Linux):
    - For Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop OS:
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for Intelx86 'PCs'.  These systems
         may have an Intel, or an AMD processor.
       o A 32-bit variant that is built for ARMv7 platforms.  The Odroid XU3
          and the NVidea Jetson-TK1 are examples of such platforms.
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for ARMv8 platforms.  The NVidea 
         Jetson-TX1 is an example of such platforms.
    - For the Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop OS:
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for Intelx86 'PCs'.  These systems
         may have an Intel, or an AMD processor.
       o A 64-bit variant that is built for ARMv8 platforms.  The NVidea 
         Jetson-TX1 is an example of such platforms.

1. Install prerequisite libraries
---------------------------------
  The PixeLINK SDK uses the libraries listed below.  Please install the latest
  variant of these libraries on your system.  Be sure to choose the 64-bit 
  variant for PCs and ARMv8s, the 32-bit variant for ARMv7s. 
    - SDL2.  Simple Directmedia Layer, used principally for video previewing 
      capabilities.  For instance, you can download the 2.0 version of this
      library with the following command:
         sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0
    - GNU C++ toolchain, including the G++ compiler/linker.  For instance, you
      could use the following command to install the necessary tools to build
      basic applications (including the GNU C++ toolchain):
         sudo apt-get install build-essential
    - GTK+3 and Glade, used for the (Gnome-based) GUI applications 
      captureOEMLite and simpleGui.  GTK+3 is a dependent library of Glade, so
      installing Glade will also install GTK+3.  Your version of Gnome will
      have software package management tool, it's usually easiest to use it
      to download the Glade tool.  Alternatively, you can use the following
      command to get Glade:
         [for Ubuntu 14.04] sudo apt-get install glade-gnome
         [for Ubuntu 16.04] sudo apt-get install glade
    - ffmpeg / libav.  ffmpeg is an open source video compression library, 
      while libav is a forked version of that library that was used with
      Ubuntu 14.04.  You can install the latest variant of this library as 
      follows:
         [for Ubuntu 14.04] sudo apt-get install libav-tools
         [for Ubuntu 16.04] sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

2. Install the PixeLINK SDK files
---------------------------------  
  All of the PixeLINK SDK files have been archived into the compressed archive
  file PixeLINKSdk-for-zzzzz-vx.y, where 'zzzzz' identifies the target OS for 
  the specific install (such as Ubuntu14.04-PC_64 for a 64-bit build of Ubuntu
  v14.04 on a PC platform), and 'x' and 'y' refer to the version and 
  sub-version respectively.  Before de-compressing this archive, you should 
  consider an 'appropriate' location for the PixeLINK files.  For example, a 
  single user install may want to locate the files off of the directory 
  ~/PixeLINKSdk, whereas a multi-user install would want the files located in a
  more central location.  When decompressed (using a command like tar -xzvf 
  PixeLINKSdk-for-Ubuntu14.04-PC_64-v2.0.tar.gz) , the PixeLINK SDK will be 
  expanded into the following folders:
    - lib.  This folder contains the shared libraries required to build (link) 
      camera control applications.  Your build process must be able to 'locate' 
      these libraries (see step 4 below).
    - include.  This folder contains the 'C' header files describing the 
      programmers interface to the PixeLINK API.  
    - samples.  This folder contains a series of other folders which provide 
      sample applications that use the PixeLINK API.  These folders contain all 
      of the source and makefiles needed to build the application.
    - utilities.  This folder contains any PixeLINK utility programs, provided
      in binary form.  See the READ.ME.txt file for a list of these utilities.

3. Create a PIXELINK_SDK_INC and PIXELINK_SDK_LIB environmental variables
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  These environmental variables identify the folder where the PixeLINK SDK files
  have been installed (from the previous step).  See the makefiles in the sample 
  application to see how this variable can be used to build applications.

  The easiest way to do this, is to create and export them within a startup
  script.  One way of doing this is shown in step 5.

4. Ensure your applications are building for Linux
--------------------------------------------------
  In order to create new Linux applications, you will need to ensure that the
  application uses the Linux system header files.  The PixeLINK API uses the 
  same header files for Linux and Windows.  To ensure PixeLINK API used by
  your new application includes the Linux system header files, as opposed to 
  those used by Windows, define the PIXELINK_LINUX compilation symbol.  See 
  the makefile from the sample applications for an example.

5. Configure your system so that the runtimes can find the PixeLINK shared 
objects
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You could do this by locating the shared objects in a common location (such as
  /lib) and using the ldconfig to create the necessary links to the shared 
  libraries, however this requires super user privilege.  Alternatively, you can
  add the path $PIXELINK_SDK_LIB (where PIXELINK_SDK was created in step 3 
  above) to the environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

  For example, assuming the PixeLINK SDK files from step 2 were installed to 
  the ~/PixeLINKSdk folder, you could accommodate step 3 and 5 by adding the 
  following set of commands to a particular users ~/.bashrc file:
      # +++++ PixeLINK cameras/SDK +++++
      PIXELINK_SDK_INC=~/PixeLINKSdk/include
      PIXELINK_SDK_LIB=~/PixeLINKSdk/lib
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PIXELINK_SDK_LIB
      export PIXELINK_SDK_INC
      export PIXELINK_SDK_LIB
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      # ----- PixeLINK cameras/SDK -----

6. Ensure your applications build against the PixeLINK Api
---------------------------------------------------------
  The PixeLINK API is 'packaged' as two dynamic libraries; PxLApi and JPEGDLL32.
  Be sure to include both of these libraries when linking your application, 
  paying particular attention to include PxLApi BEFORE JPEGDLL32, as the latter
  defines symbols referenced in the former.  See the sample makefiles for more
  information.

7. Add read/write privilege to the camera device(s)
---------------------------------------------------  
  PixeLINK API applications require read and write access to the USB device (the
  camera) in order to communicate with the device.  On Ubuntu, this can be 
  accomplished by creating a 'PixeLINK.rules' file in the 'etc/udev/rules.d'
  folder, that contains the following lines:
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb",ATTRS{idVendor}=="1996",MODE="0666"
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device",ATTRS{idVendor}=="1996",MODE="0666"
  Note that you will need super user privilege to create this file in this 
  folder, but once this is done, all users will be able to control all PixeLINK
  cameras connected to the system.  For instance, the following command will
  open/create this file:
    sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/PixeLINK.rules

8. Increase the amount of USB buffer space available to devices (if required)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  By default, the Linux kernel will allocate as little as 16MB of buffer space 
  for all USB devices.  For larger, higher speed devices (such as the PixeLINK 
  USB3 cameras) this is not adequate.  At 400 MB/s, 16MB of buffer space only 
  amounts to 40 ms of buffer time before data loss occurs.  Calling the API
  function PxLSetStreamState to turn on the camera stream, will return a 
  warring return code of ApiSuccessLowMemory if your system is currently
  configured for very little buffer space.  See the sample application
  lowUsbMemory for details.

  To increase the amount of USB buffer space to a more appropriate value 
  (in this case, 1GB), do the following:

  8.1 - Systems using GRUB based bootloader (such as Ubuntu running on a PC)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     - Edit the file ‘/etc/default/grub’ and look for the line 
       ‘GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”{some_text}”
     - Append ”usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000” to the end of some_text.  For 
       example:
           GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash” 
       becomes
           GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=”quiet splash usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000”
     - Effect this change with the following command:
           sudo update-grub
     - Manually set the memory limit (to 1GB) by entering the command: 
           ‘sudo modprobe usbcore usbfs_memory_mb=1000’
     - Reboot your system for this change to take effect.

  8.2 - Nvidia Jetsons:
          Tk1  (with L4T drivers version 21.1 or newer)
          Tx1  (with L4T drivers version 24.1 or newer)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
     The Jetson does not use the GRUB bootloader.  However, it does provide a 
     means to ‘configure’ the USB environment, making it more suitable for a
     high speed USB camera.  In particular, the following file must be edited:
          ‘/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf’
     In particular, ensure the APPEND definition contains the following two
     entries:
          usb_port_owner_info=2
          usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=1000
     Note that the usb_port_owner_info entry may already be there, but set to a
     value of 0.  A 0 value will have the USB port operate in USB2 mode, while
     a value of 2 is necessary for USB3 operation.  
  
  8.3 - Other Embedded platforms (such as the Ubuntu running ARM based platforms
        like the ODROID-XU3).
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
     For these systems, the amount of USB buffer space is 'hard-coded' within
     the (kernel) USB driver.  To change the amount of buffer space used, you 
     will have to:
      - Download the kernel source code.
      - Locate and edit the file 'drivers/usb/core/devio.c' making the following
        change:
           static unsigned usbfs_memory_mb = 16 
        becomes
           static unsigned usbfs_memory_mb = 1000
      - Recompile the kernel.
      - Install the new kernel.
